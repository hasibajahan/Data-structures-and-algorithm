// Problem statement:
// Given a sorted array arr and an integer k, find the position(0-based indexing) at which k is present in the array using 
// binary search.
// Note: If multiple occurrences are there, return the first occurrence.

// Approch:
// 1. Start with two pointers: start at the beginning and end at the end of the array.

// 2. Use a while loop that runs as long as start <= end.

// 3. Calculate the middle index: mid = (start + end) / 2.

// 4. If arr[mid] == k, store the index and move end to (mid - 1) to search in the left half.

// 5. If k > arr[mid], move start to mid + 1 to search the right half.

// 6. If k < arr[mid], move end to mid - 1 to search the left half.

// 7. Continue until the loop ends. The variable index will hold the first occurrence if found.

// 8. Return index.

//***Time complexity: O(log N)
//Binary Search works by halving the search space each time.
//So for an array of size N, the number of steps to find the element is approximately log(N).

//***Space complexity: O(1)
//Weâ€™re not using any extra data structures (like arrays, lists, hashmaps).
