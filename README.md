# üìö Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice repository!  
This repo is a collection of all the DSA problems I‚Äôve solved while learning core computer science concepts and preparing for coding interviews.

## Why I Created This Repo

I‚Äôm currently learning and mastering data structures and algorithms through consistent daily practice. This repository helps me:

- Track my learning progress
- Review previously solved problems
- Showcase my DSA understanding

##  My Learning Plan (DSA Roadmap)

I‚Äôm following a structured path to master DSA, which I found on [NeetCode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Here‚Äôs the roadmap I‚Äôm using:

1. Arrays & Hashing
2. Two Pointers
3. Stack
4. Binary Search
5. Sliding Window
6. Linked List
7. Trees
8. Tries
9. Heap / Priority Queue
10. Intervals
11. Greedy
12. Advanced Graphs
13. Backtracking
14. Graphs
15. 1-D Dynamic Programming (DP)
16. 2-D Dynamic Programming (DP)
17. Bit Manipulation
18. Math & Geometry

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is being organized by DSA topics (e.g., Arrays, Trees, Graphs, etc.).  
The structure will be updated progressively as more topics and solutions are added.
